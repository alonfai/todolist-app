## State management

This project using the React Context API and the `useReducer` hook for managing its local state of tasks throughout the system.

The main project folders are located inside the `src` folder:

* components - React functional components for Displaying, Viewing, Editing and rendering **Task** objects.
  * Add - Render a form for adding a new Task to the system
  * Edit - Renders a modal window for user to be able to edit the priorirty of a task
  * List - Renders a List of tasks
  * Task - Renders a single record of a given task inside a table `<tr />` element
* context - code logic for the state management code (using native React hooks `useContext` and `useReducer`)
* mocks - collection of mock objects used throughout the unit/integration tests
* pages - React components associated with available url routes user can access throughtout the project
  * NoMatch - any invalid route user type in the browser will render this page
  * Root - Main application page
* shared - collection of shared utilitiy functions, constants, custom JS Error objects and shared TypeScript interfaces
* types - custom typescript definition types

***

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. The app will reload if you make edits.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner. It takes all files with `.spec.*` or  `.test.*` extensions and executes all coding assertions.

### `yarn test:debug`

launches the Jest testing in debug mode

### `yarn coverage`

produces a test coverage report under coverage folder

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

You can then deploy the app to your production environment and/or add this as part of your CI/CD pipeline

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**
